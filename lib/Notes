The plugin seeded-generation has been uninstalled. Functionality from 
the plugin remains so that custom generators built by the plugin 
will still work and you can still individually rake the seeds. 
These generators will be found in the ../lib/generators/seeded_* 
folders.

To completely remove the functionality of this plugin, you must manually.
1. Delete the folder ../lib/seeded_generation. It should only contain
   the files override_rake_task.rb and Notes.
   
2. Delete the file ../lib/tasks/seeded_generation_task.rake."

3. From the Rakefile, remove the line:

      require 'seeded_generation/override_rake_task'" 

4. The db/seeds path will remain in environment.rb as well as the
   require statements in db/seeds.rb. 

Custom generators will continue to work and db:seed will still update
seeds. Only the ability to seed individual models will then be disabled.

If custom generators in the ../lib/generators/seeded_* folders are no
longer needed. You can delete them manually as well.
