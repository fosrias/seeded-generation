seeded-generation plugin by Mark W. Foster
==========================================

This plugin extends any model and scaffold generators to stub individual seeds
files that correspond to a model and its module directory structure. It also
overrides rake db:seed so that models can be individually seeded 
using rake db:seed with the model name as an option. The plugin also includes 
a generator that just stubs seeds files for existing models.

The db/seeds.rb file is updated when models are generated to require the individual
model seeds files so that rake db:seed executes all the required seed files. Extended
model and scaffold generators include an option --skip-seeds that blocks stubbing
a seeds file for the model and an option --seeds-only that only stubs a 
seeds file for the model.

Two default seeded generators are built as part of the install: 

seeded_model and seeded_scaffold.

Type script/generate seeded, script/generate seeds_for, script/seeded_model or
script/seeded_scaffold for more usage information.

Uninstalling the plugin leaves any extended generators and the db:seed
override working. To clear all plugin functionality, refer to the 
notes in the ../lib/seeded_generation folder after uninstalling the plugin.

The plugin also installs functionality from the plugin OverrideRakeTask 
by Eugene Bolshakov found at: git://github.com/eugene bolshakov/override_rake_task.git

Example
=======

script/generate seeded my_model_generator

creates a new seeded_my_model_generator generator that can then be used just like the 
my_model_generator generator it is based on in the following fashion:

script/generate seeded_my_model_generator MyModule::MyModel 

creates generates all the standard model directories and stubs and includes
the stub ../db/seeds/my_module/my_model_seeds.rb and adds 
require 'my_module/my_model_seeds' to the db/seeds.rb file.

script/generate seeded_my_model_generator MyModule::MyModel --skip-seeds 

is just the base generator.

script/generate seeded_my_model_generator MyModule::MyModel --only-seeds 

only adds the file ../db/seeds/my_module/my_model_seeds.rb and adds 
require 'my_module/my_model_seeds' to the db/seeds.rb file.

This has the same functionality of the included generator seeds_for:

script/generate seeds_for MyModule::MyModel

which creates only a file db/seeds/my_module/my_model_seeds.rb and 
adds a require statement to seeds.db.

rake db:seed runs all seed files required in db/seeds.rb and 
any other seed code there.

rake db:seed MODELS=MyModule1::MyModel1, MyModule1::MyModel2 only loads seeds for the 
specified models if they have corresponding seeds.rb files generated.
